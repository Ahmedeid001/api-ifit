This tension, a signal for muscles to grow, is crucial across all hypertrophy exercises. To maximize it, focus on lifting weights in a way that challenges the muscles through both the amount lifted and the technique used.\r\n<br>\r\nMaximizing Muscle Tension: Achieved by challenging muscles with the weight and lifting method.\r\n<br>\r\n<h1>2. Technique<\/h1>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrect technique is vital for applying tension to the intended muscles. Key aspects include:\r\n<br>\r\nControlling the Negative: Emphasize a slower descent to make the eccentric phase more effective for growth. Avoid letting weights drop quickly. Aim for a controlled 1-2 second negative in every exercise.\r\nRange of Motion: Full movement is encouraged in each exercise, supporting both hypertrophy and functionality. Avoid shortcuts like incomplete lockouts to maintain and improve functionality.\r\nConsistent Form: Keep your form steady, especially when increasing weights or reps. Altering form to lift more can hinder targeted muscle tension. Prioritize technique over lifting heavier.\r\n<br>\r\n<\/h1>3. Effort and Intensity<\/h1>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get the most benefit out of strength and hypertrophy progressions, you have to push to, or near failure on your last (if you are new to this type of training) or last two (if more experienced) sets of each exercise. This approach, which involves performing reps until proper form can’t be maintained, has been found to be one of the single best factors for promoting muscle growth, according to recent studies.\r\n<br>\r\n<h1>4. Progressive Overload <\/h1>\r\n<br>\r\nProgressive overload involves gradually increasing the stress placed on your body during exercise training. This can be done by adding more weight, increasing the frequency of workouts, or doing more repetitions in strength training. This gradual progression leads to continuous improvement and adaptation. This principle is key to ongoing muscle development and adaptation.", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/how-to-be-a-successful-spotter-header-400x225.jpg?alt=media&token=3b750996-dce7-49c7-9257-d4c14f8d6f50", "note": "Muscle growth hinges on the tension created during resistance training.

RPE assesses effort and fatigue, where an RPE of 8 equates to 2 RIR, indicating two reps could be performed before failure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why RIR Matters<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Progressive Overload<\/strong>: Central to strength training, progressive overload necessitates continuously challenging your muscles to ensure ongoing growth and improvements. RIR facilitates this by helping you gauge the right weight that offers a challenge without leading to overexertion.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Fatigue Management<\/strong>: Training to complete muscle failure in every set can quickly deplete your energy reserves and negatively impact your performance in subsequent sets or workouts. RIR allows for a more sustainable approach, helping maintain energy levels and performance consistency across your training sessions.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Injury Prevention<\/strong>: Pushing to failure increases the risk of compromising form, potentially leading to injuries. By incorporating RIR, you’re more likely to maintain proper technique throughout each exercise, significantly reducing the risk of injury.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Training Longevity<\/strong>: Consistently training at or near failure can lead to burnout and overtraining, hindering long-term progress. RIR supports sustained progress by preventing excessive fatigue and promoting recovery.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Implementing RIR in Your Training <\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporating RIR into your routine is straightforward:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Determine Your RIR<\/strong>: Decide how many reps you want to leave in reserve. This might vary based on your training phase, goals, and the specific exercise.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Select Appropriate Weights<\/strong>: Choose weights that allow you to reach the desired RIR. This might require some experimentation and adjustments.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Monitor Your Progress<\/strong>: Keep track of the weights you’re lifting and the corresponding RIR to ensure continuous progress.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong> Reps in Reserve is a powerful concept in strength training that prioritizes intelligent effort over maximal exertion. It champions the idea that stopping short of failure can lead to better gains, longer training careers, and fewer injuries. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced athlete, incorporating RIR into your training regimen can significantly enhance your strength training efficacy and enjoyment.<\/p>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/how-to-best-shake-up-your-gym-routine-header-400x225.jpg?alt=media&token=187e7d22-9cd2-4ce8-9ce6-cebdd194d4c5", "note": "What does RIR (Reps In Reserve) mean?

    { "id": "19", "name": "Energy Systems Training", "description": "\r\n<p>Understanding the energy systems in the body is crucial for effective training. Our program integrates workouts that tap into various energy pathways to ensure a comprehensive approach to fitness. It’s important to note that <strong>these systems often overlap<\/strong> during exercises, offering a nuanced and well-rounded training regimen. Here, we delve into each energy system and provide examples of workouts that predominantly utilize them:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Anaerobic Alactic or Phosphocreatine System (ATP-PC)<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This energy system is activated during short, high-intensity activities lasting about <strong>10-15 seconds<\/strong>. It provides a quick burst of energy, making it essential for power-based workouts. Here are some basic examples of exercises that predominantly tap into this system:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Sprint<\/strong>: A 100m dash where you give your maximum effort.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Heavy Lifting<\/strong>: Lifting a heavy weight for 1-3 repetitions, like a max effort deadlift or squat.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Jumping<\/strong>: Performing high-intensity jumps, like box jumps or broad jumps, in quick succession.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Throwing<\/strong>: Activities like medicine ball throws where maximum power is required for a short duration.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Short Duration Rowing or Cycling<\/strong>: Going all out for a 15-second row or cycle sprint.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Anaerobic Lactic or Glycolytic System<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This system comes into play for activities that last about <strong>30 seconds to 2 minutes<\/strong>, providing energy through the breakdown of carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. It is utilized in high-intensity, short-duration workouts. Here are some examples:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>400m Run<\/strong>: A middle-distance run where you maintain a high intensity throughout.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Circuit Training<\/strong>: A circuit of exercises performed back-to-back with little to no rest, lasting for around a minute.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)<\/strong>: Workouts where you perform exercises at a high intensity for intervals lasting up to 2 minutes.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Complex Lifts<\/strong>: Performing a series of complex lifts continuously for a minute or two.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Burpees<\/strong>: Doing a set of burpees at a fast pace for a minute.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Aerobic System<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The aerobic system is the dominant energy system for activities lasting<strong> longer than 2 minutes<\/strong>. It utilizes oxygen to generate energy from carbohydrates and fats. This system is essential for endurance and long-duration activities. Here are some examples:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Long-Distance Running<\/strong>: Engaging in a 5k or 10k run where you maintain a steady pace.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Cycling<\/strong>: Going for a long bike ride at a moderate pace.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Swimming<\/strong>: Swimming laps continuously for an extended period.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Rowing<\/strong>: Engaging in a long-duration rowing session at a moderate intensity.<\/li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><span class=\"tooltipsall tooltip_post_id_2821 classtoolTips2821\" data-hasqtip=\"0\">AMRAP<\/span> Workouts<\/strong>: Workouts where you perform as many rounds as possible of a series of exercises in a given time frame, usually lasting 20 or more minutes.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our approach<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of our training program is to have members spend the most of their training within the aerobic system range, often touching but never crossing the lactic threshold.

    { "id": "20", "name": "5 Biggest Mistakes People Make in the Gym", "description": "<p>I’ve been a gymrat for over a decade. Trust me when I tell you, I’ve made every mistake in the book after many failed diet and training attempts that left me feeling frustrated, hopeless and questioning if I will ever achieve my fitness goals. In the process I learned the importance of having a plan.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>1. Going in without a plan<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>By far, the number one mistake of gym goers is moseying into the iron temple not having a clue of what they are about to do. This is forgivable once in a while, but consistently showing up with a lackadaisical attitude and no general objective for the session will eventually come back to haunt you. Do yourself a favor and get equipped with a basic training program that will give you more structure and consistency-- it doesn’t have to be anything fancy!&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h2>2. Skipping the warm-up<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Tons of people walk right into the gym and head straight to the squat rack. That may work for some people, but the majority of the population needs some sort of warm-up protocol to prepare their tissues and their minds for the training session. This is going to look different for everyone, but a good place to start is a quick 3-5 minutes of general cardiovascular exercise to increase blood flow, followed by a relevant mobility flow to address any joint stiffness that could impede movement efficiency during the workout.&nbsp;<\/p><br> \r\n<h2>3. Changing your exercises too frequently<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>The concept of “muscle confusion” has been debunked time after time. In order to strengthen or grow a body part we need consistent and targeted stimulus. That alone requires practice; to get better at a movement and really dial in your mind muscle connection you need to repeatedly practice it so you can recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and really squeeze the juice out of the exercise.<\/p><br> \r\n<h2>4. Ignoring what you do with the other 23 hours of your day<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>This one might hit pretty close to home, as it is the stem of the frustration of many gym goers. Going to the gym for an hour a day is not enough to make up for a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. Make sure the other 23 hours in your day reflect your goals just as much as that one hour banging weights does. This applies to your recovery, diet, sleep, social life etc.<\/p><br> \r\n<h2>5. Thinking everyone is looking at you<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Last but not least, this one is huge. Gym anxiety can be paralyzing, especially for people who are new to training. As much as I can sit here and yell at you NO ONE CARES!, I know it’s easier said than done to ignore that part of your brain that tells you everyone is watching you. The only way to get over that barrier is to face it head-on. The more frequently you expose yourself to that uncomfortable situation of being in the gym, the easier it gets. You just have to get some momentum and allow yourself to form a callus over that fear with time. Trust me, you can do it.<\/p>\r\n", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/5-biggest-mistakes-people-make-in-the-gym-header-830x467.jpg?alt=media&token=8f5fb397-36c7-44d2-be15-5870f3153214", "note": "I’ve been a gymrat for over a decade.

    { "id": "21", "name": "How & When To Use a Weightlifting Belt", "description": "<h2>Why The Belt?<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>The weightlifting belt is one of the most crucial pieces of equipment in heavy lifting. For competitors and amateurs alike, this can preserve the health of your spine while working with heavy loads. However, there’s more to it than just strapping it around your stomach and expecting heavier lifts. The belt has its time and a place in your workout. When used right, the belt can improve your performance in compound lifts and the strength of your core.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>How to Use It<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, the belt is put around the core and above the hip bones. The weightlifting belt will not be strapped in the same spot for everybody. It’s a piece of equipment that takes practice through trial and error in order to find how it can be most effective. For example, the deadlift mechanics may require a different height for the belt than the overhead press. What matters most is how it can be used to brace the body for compound muscle recruitment.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>The most important muscles for the belt are in the core and the glutes. A lifting belt reduces spinal shrinkage during compound exercises. As a result, it can stabilize the lower back and glutes during functional loading . This is great for anyone who experiences low-back pain, because it is almost always caused by weak glutes and hamstrings.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The tightness of the belt takes practice too. Lifting with a belt requires different muscle recruitment in the core. Some athletes are trained to brace their core inwards while exercising. The belt requires outward flexion instead, as if the core is bracing for a gut punch. It’s important that the belt should not constrict air flow so it can brace the core outward. If lifters are using a belt for the first time, finding the proper buckle is the first learning curve that needs adjusting. There are some breathing techniques such as the Valsalva maneuver that help with this core engagement.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>When to Use It<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Belts are most effective during compound exercises in which one is one their feet. These exercises are also closed-chain movements which require abdominal pressure, hence the belt. They should not be worn for extension or supine movements. Belts come into use for barbell versions of the deadlift, squat, clean, snatch, and the overhead press. A lifting belt has especially been shown to have a positive effect on exertion in deadlifts .<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Athletes participating in powerlifting can benefit from the belt. The sport involves moving weight from one point to another by any means. A belt can make the sport safer for its competitors. Lifters can benefit from the belt if performing around 80% or more of their one-rep max. Any lower weight may not call for one, unless a focus on breathwork is a desired practice. Lifters who compete in events should practice with one in order to maximize their numbers and prevent injury before the event.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Athletes with previous injuries in or around the spine can benefit from the belt as well. It can act as a safety net, assuring that lumbar extension is not excessive. However, if someone is only experiencing acute low-back pain, they should opt to improve their form mechanics before wearing a belt and increasing the weight. For both groups, warming up the core before exercising can be beneficial.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Belts should not be used during regular exercise. Some bodybuilders wear the belt in order to shrink their waist size, creating a V-taper before a show. This is not an optimal way to strengthen the core, especially for function.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Lastly, belts are not an excuse for weak abdominal muscles. They are a safety net for lifters working with heavy loads. If a stronger core is a personal goal, exercises for the core will show far more improvements. The belt is not a magical accessory for better abs, it’s a piece of equipment for physical activity.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h2>Wrap-Up<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Compound lifts are the core to a lifter’s routine. The belt ensures these lifters that they can improve the safety of these exercises while not impeding their gains. Not only will it minimize possible disadvantages, but it will improve the mechanics and results for lifters.<\/p><br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/abs-and-forearms-into-your-routine-header-400x225.jpg?alt=media&token=5c336f27-ab16-412b-a6f5-cc6d1012aae7", "note": "Why The Belt?The weightlifting belt is one of the most crucial pieces of equipment in heavy lifting.

There is some discipline required to maintain a consistent calorie surplus, but this adversity is offset by the muscle and strength gains you receive. Yet once the bulk is finished, it’s time for the cut. This is a time of cutting calories and extra cardio. It’s a time highly dreaded yet highly necessary. Learn how to make the weight loss journey of your training and diet as simple and painless as possible.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Basics of weight loss<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>While we condone consuming a healthy diet in order to promote healthy weight loss and wellness, the only real requirement to losing weight is to maintain a calorie deficit over the course of several days or weeks. To achieve this requires the calories you burn in a day to be greater than the calories you consume. Fewer calories often conjures up images of starvation and miniscule portion sizes. We’re here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be this way.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>Getting your food choices in check, packing your diet full of quality lean protein, and filling up on whole foods will put you on the right track for shedding body weight and achieving your weight loss goals without too much of that dreaded hunger.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Essential foods for healthy eating<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>The key to picking foods is to select high protein options as well as high volume options. Protein preserves muscle mass and maintains satiety. Some great sources of craving-controlling proteins are chicken, lean ground beef, or low-fat greek yogurt. If you’re wanting something more plant based, then chickpeas, quinoa, black beans, legumes, or a high-quality protein supplement are other useful options.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Larger volume foods with low calories are also great for controlling hunger and increasing health benefits: most veggies, leafy greens, low-calorie fruits such as blueberries, or things like popcorn work well. These foods are typically also high fiber, meaning they help with digestion, another great way to assist in weight management. Gut health keeps bloating down, which will keep you motivated during your weight loss plan.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Our final recommendation is foods that take a while to eat. These include soups and other hot meals that take time to consume. The slower you eat, the better your body is able to avoid overeating.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Superfoods in action<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Weight loss diets don’t have to be hellish. There’s no requirement to get rid of carbs or throw out every gram of saturated fat. It all just comes down to calories in and calories out. At the end of the day, listen to your body and just stay aware of how the food your eating makes you feel. Eat what makes you happy and what gets you closer to your goals.<\/p><br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/best-foods-for-weight-loss-header-400x225.jpg?alt=media&token=8b302b4a-6d57-4e24-88dc-24c382f164d7", "note": "The time of the bulk is one of joy.

    { "id": "23", "name": "How to Increase Testosterone for Optimal Performan", "description": "<p>When it comes to testosterone, it’s more than just a hormone that helps with your sex drive. It helps your heart make new red blood cells, increases blood flow, promotes bone growth and density, increases muscle mass, aids in distribution of fat around the body, and other processes in the body .&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s important to understand how you can increase your levels naturally. Here are 4 tips on how to naturally increase your testosterone levels for optimal performance.<\/p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Catching Those Quality ZZZ’s<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>In order for your hormones to be balanced properly, you’ll need to ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep each night. When it comes to testosterone and sleep, there may be a correlation. In fact, one study took data on over 2,000 teenage boys and men and found that impaired sleep was linked to lower levels of testosterone .&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<p>While there is no magic number for how many hours you should sleep, there was a small study that showed only sleeping five hours per night reduced testosterone by 10-15%, so we definitely recommend more than that. Most research suggests at least seven hours of sleep per night, so make sure to aim for that severe to eight-hour mark .&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>A Balanced Plate&nbsp;<\/h3><br> \r\n<p>What you eat and the quantity also plays a role in testosterone production. It is important to remember that constant dieting can negatively affect your hormone levels including testosterone.&nbsp;<\/p><br> \r\n<p>Instead, you want to make sure you are properly balancing your macronutrients (proteins, carbs, and fats). Protein helps limit sex hormone-binding globulin and when you limit this, it helps your body produce more free testosterone to do its job. Carbohydrates help play a role in controlling cortisol levels which affects testosterone. In a small study, researchers found that low-carbohydrate diets do negatively affect cortisol and testosterone levels. As for fats, there is some research that shows low fat diets can lead to decreased testosterone.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>At the end of the day, you want to have a nutritious, well balanced diet consisting mainly of whole foods. A healthy balance of your macronutrients will help ensure your hormone levels are optimized for performance and support overall health.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>Loosen Up&nbsp;<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Stop stressing! When it comes to testosterone levels, stress can have quite a large impact. We’ve mentioned it before, but cortisol levels and testosterone have a direct correlation. When you have a lot of stress, especially prolonged amounts, it diminishes your testosterone levels.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Not only does stress impact cortisol levels, but it also causes other behaviors like increased food intake. Like mentioned above, you want to have a well balanced diet. If you increase food intake excessively, you will gain fat, especially around your organs. These factors could also negatively affect your testosterone levels<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h3>Move and Pick Up The Weights<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Last but not certainly not least, you need to move. Studies show that active men compared to sedentary men have higher testosterone levels. What training should you do and how intense? It depends. In one review, they studied these questions and the effects on testosterone. While more studies need to be done, it does show the majority of any exercise and training intensity does raise testosterone levels.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Now, there are studies out there that show resistance training like weightlifting can have a remarkably positive effect on testosterone . Because of this, it is recommended that you do some type of resistance training if you’re looking to increase testosterone and optimize your performance.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>Knowing Where You Are<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>While you can follow these 4 tips and assume your testosterone levels are where they need to be. You will not truly know unless you get tested. Luckily, we have LetsGetChecked’s male hormone tests. Want to know the best things about these tests? You can complete them from the comfort of your home, you get results within 2-5 days of shipping it back, and they have follow-up care available.

It’s strengthening the synaptic connections between your mind and your muscles as you exercise. This is something that develops over time. If you ask a beginner to flex their quadricep, they’ll likely be unable to. This is because their neurotransmitters aren’t used to firing in that specific pattern. However, after months of regularly performing deadlifts or leg extensions, they’ll likely have little issue doing so.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h2>If it just happens over time, do I need to do anything?<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>This would be the obvious question to ask next. It appears that the more reps you do, the better mind-muscle connection you’ll have. Seems simple enough. However, working through a normal strength training program won’t be enough to really maximize what this training hack can do for you.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>This method of focused muscle contraction can have great effects when it comes to hypertrophy. Since building muscle is all about breaking down muscle fibers, then focusing on that will be our main goal in the gym. A strong mind-muscle connection does just that. Feeling specific muscles engage in each part of a full range of motion is going to ensure that you’re getting the fullest amount of work from them possible. This also ensures that you’re hitting your target muscles and not accidentally engaging some other muscles.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Building it into your routine<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Compound movements are great for activating multiple muscle groups. Yet in order to best maximize mind-muscle connection when first starting out, you’re going to want to employ isolation exercises in your favor. These are great because they allow you to focus on one muscle at a time to really feel them work. Starting by slowly feeling your triceps work in a push down is going to be perfect. Keep the repetitions controlled and utilize a lighter weight. This way, you don’t have to think too hard about form and can instead devote your attention to how your triceps are feeling as they contract and relax. Do these types of isolation exercises for each muscle group you want to work: pec flys, side delt flys, bicep curls, glute kickbacks, any any other form of pinpointed muscle work.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>This type of training will take time and repetition in order for those synaptic connections to really form. If you’re able to flex muscles individually, you’ll know you’re on the right track. Once this confidence starts to set in, take this mind-muscle connection into your compound lifts. Focus on feeling your muscles work in tandem the next time you’re doing a bench press, squat, or barbell row. Eventually, this mind-muscle connection will become so ingrained in your lifts that you activate the neural pathways without even being conscious about it. Pretty soon, you’ll be finding yourself explaining its complexities to your gym partner. Get that brain to work, and level up your weightlifting routine. There’s no reason brain and brawn shouldn’t combine to give you the best possible results.<\/p><br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/how-to-best-shake-up-your-gym-routine-header-400x225.jpg?alt=media&token=187e7d22-9cd2-4ce8-9ce6-cebdd194d4c5", "note": "If you spend enough time in the bodybuilder realm, you’re bound to hear this confusing phrase touted as one of the prime ways to build muscle.

    { "id": "28", "name": "Top 5 Oils to Use for Cooking", "description": "<p>When it comes to healthy cooking oils, there is plenty of unscientific information floating around the Internet. It feels like everyday you are told that the oil you have been using is now unhealthy. The latest attack has been on seed oils, such as canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soy, and sunflower oils. The first argument is that seed oils are filled with toxic byproducts from the use of chemical solvents, such as hexane. The second argument is that seed oils are unhealthy for you because they primarily contain omega-6 polyunsaturated fat.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>According to Harvard School of Public Health, the scientific evidence does not support these claims, because there is no clear evidence linking trace amounts of solvents to health issues. Evidence has shown that seed oils can actually help lower cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and reduce the risk of heart disease.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h2>What is the best oil to use?<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>According to Teresa Fung at the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of &shy;Public Health, the nutrient makeup of your cooking oils is “not going to make a difference in terms of health, especially if you eat a healthy diet”. So go ahead and use your choice of minimally processed oil with moderation within the context of a well balanced diet.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Here are three main factors when considering what oil to use: saturated or unsaturated fat, stability under heated conditions, and the amount of processing.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>1. Saturated or Unsaturated Fat<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>All fats can contain mix of three types of fat: monounsaturated fat contains omega-9 and is found in almonds, hazelnuts, avocados, sesame seeds, and olive oil; polyunsaturated fat contains omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and is found in fish, walnut oil, flaxseed oil, and vegetable oils; saturated fat is usually solid at room temperature and is found in animal fat, butter, coconut oil, and palm oil. The healthiest oils are those that are highest in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as vegetable oil and olive oil, which can help lower your bad cholesterol, raise your good cholesterol, and reduce your risk of heart disease.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>2. Stability Under Heated Conditions<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>When it comes to cooking, some oils can handle the heat, and some can’t. An oil's ‘smoke point’ is the temperature at which it will start to smoke and break down. When oil hits that temperature, the molecules start to burn, destabilize, and lose their nutrients. Oils that reach their smoke point also release free radicals and a substance called acrolein which can cause lung irritation . In a similar vein, when oils are repeatedly heated, such as in deep-frying, the oil leads to lipid oxidation, which is inextricably linked to detrimental health effects such as cardiovascular disease.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Here are some smoke point examples:<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Unrefined seed oils smoke at 225°F.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Butter smokes at 302°F.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Extra Virgin olive oil smokes at 320°F.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Refined oils smoke between 400°F and 500°F.<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>You should choose your oils based on your cooking method. Low smoke point oils such as flaxseed oil, extra-virgin olive oil, nut oils, and sesame oil can lose flavor and denature quickly when heated, so you should reserve them for salad dressing or drizzling on your finished dishes. Medium smoke point oils such as avocado oil, corn oil, canola oil, or virgin olive oil can be used for sauteing over medium heat. High smoke point oils such as peanut oil, soybean oil, light olive oil, and grapeseed oil can be used for high-heat frying, stir-frying, or roasting.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>3. Processing Method<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>The processing of your cooking oil can also dramatically change its flavor, color, smoke point, and health benefits. Highly refined oils are less expensive, have a uniform appearance, and much higher smoke points. Unrefined oils tend to be more costly, contain sediment, appear cloudier, have lower smoke points, but they do have more natural flavor.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Why should you even bother with using cooking oils?<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Cooking oils contain fat, which is an essential macronutrient for a healthy diet that contains essential fatty acids not made by the human body. These fatty acids can help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fat also helps facilitate the absorption of protein and the repairing of damaged tissue. In addition, fat is digested slower than protein or carbs, which can keep you feeling satiated longer. Fat can help regulate your metabolism and blood sugar and lower your risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>On the culinary side, cooking with fat can produce more delicious food. Greasing a pan can prevent food from sticking. Coating veggies with oil will allow for more even cooking. Adding oil to meat will enhance texture by browning the exterior, adding crispiness, keeping in moisture, concentrating flavors, and\/or increasing aromas. Fat will also coat your taste buds with a smooth mouth feel, providing pleasurable richness .<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Five of the healthiest cooking oils according to science<\/h2><br>\r\n<p><strong>1. Olive Oil<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Olive oil is on top of this list because of its versatility and well documented health benefits. Olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, has antioxidant properties, and can help reduce the ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol and improve ‘good’ HDL cholesterol. There are two main types of olive oil: unrefined or refined. Unrefined olive oil, labeled as ‘extra-virgin olive oil,’ is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. Due to its lower smoke point at 320°F, EVOO is best used for medium heat cooking, baking, and salad dressings . Refined olive oil, labeled as light olive oil, is treated with some heat and chemicals to remove impurities and boost cooking stability. With its higher smoke point of 470°F, you can cook on high heats. Olive oil not only tastes great but is the cornerstone of the health promoting mediterranean diet.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Avocado Oil<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Avocado oil is similar to extra virgin olive oil, with its high monounsaturated fat contents and a high percentage of the heart-healthy fat, oleic acid. However, it has the added advantage of having a higher smoking point at approximately 520°F, allowing for higher cooking temperatures. One Study found that avocado oil maintains its nutritional quality at both low and high temperatures. This is a great option for high heat cooking. Plus avocado oil is neutral in flavor and can be used in any dish, including baked goods.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>3. Sesame Oil<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Sesame oil is one of the oldest oils used in human civilization . It has been named the ‘Queen of Seed Oils,’ because of its resistance to oxidation and rancidity in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties. Sesame oil contains mostly polyunsaturated fatty acids and has a medium-high smoke point of approximately 410°F. Sesame seed oil has the added benefit of containing high amounts of vitamin K. It also contains anti-inflammatory compounds such as sesamol and sesaminol. which have been shown to lower cholesterol, prevent high blood pressure, increase vitamin E supplies, regulate blood sugar, and may even help with injury recovery. Sesame oil works well as a general cooking oil or salad dressing. It has a mild nutty flavor that can pair well with Asian and Middle Eastern dishes. As a word of caution, toasted sesame oil should only be used to finish dishes and shouldn’t be heated.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>4. Grapeseed Oil<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Grapeseed oil is another great cooking oil because it is rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid, vitamins, and phenolic compounds that may have anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Grapeseed oil has a high smoke point of 420°F, making it ideal for high heat cooking such as sautéing, roasting, and air frying. Grapeseed oil has a neutral flavor which can be used in all types of cooking and baking. It may promote overall skin health by tightening and contracting skin cells. The downside of this oil is that it is derived from the seeds of grapes and requires some chemical solvents to create, which may result in trace amounts of potentially harmful impurities such as hexane .<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>5. Coconut Oil<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>Unlike the previous four plant based unsaturated fat oils, coconut oil contains a fair amount of saturated fat. Although coconut oil has saturated fat, it contains a rich source of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which have been shown to help in weight loss, body fat regulation, and hip circumference reduction. MCTs are metabolized differently than long chain triglycerides, going straight to the liver to provide a rapid energy source similar to carbohydrates. There are two types of coconut oil. Unrefined coconut oil has a long shelf life but a medium smoke point of 350°F. Refined coconut oil has a more neutral flavor but has a high heat-resistance of 400°F. Both versions have powerful health benefits, such as improving cholesterol levels, killing harmful bacteria, helping with inflammation, and boosting metabolism. The taste of coconut oil can range in intensity from distinctly tropical to almost neutral. Coconut oil is a staple in Southeast Asia, South America, and Polynesia cuisine for its warm nutty vanilla undertones.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Whichever oil you choose, do it with confidence in your knowledge of its potential health benefits.<\/p> ", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/top-5-oils-to-use-for-cooking-header-830x467.jpg?alt=media&token=7ce57960-17f8-42bc-be6c-500e7c7c63e7", "note": "When it comes to healthy cooking oils, there is plenty of unscientific information floating around the Internet.

    { "id": "30", "name": "Impact of Healthy Fats on Women", "description": "<p>Fats help absorb vitamins and minerals. While their tasks in every body remain the same, their presence differs between men and women. Women naturally hold more fat mass than men, so they rely more on these fats (lipids) for energy. It makes sense for women to eat more fats to support their energy levels. Healthy fats play a pivotal role in women by regulating hormones and exercise endurance.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Lipids &amp; Hormones<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>It’s important to consider the menstrual cycle in women’s nutrition. The menstrual cycle involves peaks and dips of hormones between a 21-35 day period. This cycle can also cause a cycle of nutrients.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>Fats can help support menstrual cycles. The presence of certain hormones such as estrogen and progestogen can prominently affect women’s nutrient requirements.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The early days of the follicular phase lowers estrogen and muscle glycogen levels, resulting in an increased carb intake. Then, the follicle grows and releases estrogen, stimulating its first peak in the cycle. This peak will occur during the final few days of the follicular phase. A high intake of carbohydrates can be more helpful for the follicular phase leading up to the hormonal peak (ovulation). However, an overconsumption of carbohydrates too soon could lead to heightened inflammation and reduced muscle glycogen utilization . Conversely, estrogen can also increase fat oxidation and decrease carbohydrate dependence. Therefore, a lower carbohydrate intake could be considered for daily use .<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Women need more protein in the luteal phase to support the increase of protein oxidation . After ovulation, the body needs these nutrients to recover from ovulation. In the luteal phase, progesterone upregulation calls for more protein and overall energy. Since women are fat-adapted, the overall energy intake can be beneficial through fats. While there is an upcoming second peak in estrogen, progestogens are naturally higher in the luteal phase. This should also be considered for active women, who should adjust their protein intake accordingly.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Post-menopausal women experience an increase in fat mass and a decrease in lean mass. The Mediterranean Diet can improve lean body mass and cholesterol levels. A high-fat, low-carb diet is not recommended as a fat reduction approach. An alternative path would be a low-GI diet consisting of fibrous foods .<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Exercising &amp; Women&nbsp;<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Menstrual cycles affect performance in women. Keeping in mind that women rely more on fats for energy, they can become fat-adapted during exercise. This causes women to metabolize more fat than men, even with the same exercise intensity. This also makes them less susceptible to fatigue (given where they are in their cycle). Women could last longer than men in endurance performances simply because of natural physiology. Endurance has varied between women in either phase. What matters is that women still have a higher endurance than men .<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The time of their cycle also changes how they should recover from performance through nutrition. When planning out strength and endurance training, women should schedule around their cycle in order to prevent injury. They may be more prone to inflammation after ovulation. Progestogen has foiling actions to estrogen, classifying it as a catabolic hormone. This can make women more prone to injury during their luteal phase .<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Best Healthy Fats<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>The menstrual cycle affects strength, metabolism, body temperature, fluid balance, and risk of injury. These can all be mediated through nutrition. Women should consider adding these healthy fat sources to their diet.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Omega-3’s contain anti-inflammatory properties that aid in recovery. These can be especially helpful in the follicular phase in which inflammation is elevated. These can be found in fatty fish and seeds .<\/p><br>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Oils are the best quality sources of pure fats. Extra virgin olive oil is high in polyunsaturated fats and antioxidants. Coconut oil, while high in saturated fat, contains many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Soy is high in polyunsaturated fats, fiber, and protein. Soy can extend the length of the menstrual cycle and lower the risk of estrogen-based diseases .&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li><p>Saturated fats should be limited for their disadvantages to gut health. Foods such as full-fat dairy, fatty red meat, and butter fall into this category.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>In Summary<\/h2>\r\n<p>Healthy fats are a great addition to any diet. When it comes to women, they may be even more important. Make sure you consume these fats from healthy sources, train hard, and train smart.<\/p>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/impact-of-healthy-fats-on-women-header-830x467.jpg?alt=media&token=473b0a2f-b62c-4b4c-82f8-99688b8d9fd2", "note": "Fats help absorb vitamins and minerals.

    { "id": "31", "name": "How to Stop Feeling Tired All the Time", "description": "<p>It’s normal to feel a general level of tiredness throughout your day so long as you can recover after a good night’s sleep or a restful weekend. However, chronic fatigue can be a multidimensional issue with physical, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive components not necessarily related to exertion, rest, or sleep . There are three main areas of exhaustion: physical activity, “I don’t have the energy to do daily tasks,” motivation, “I don’t have the desire to do anything today,” and concentration, “I don’t have the ability to focus today” . If you have one or more of these symptoms, you may want to analyze your sleep patterns, nutrition, and\/or stress.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sleep<\/h2><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep is essential for your health and alertness. Although ideal sleep duration can vary between individuals, the general consensus is that you should sleep seven or more hours per night on a regular basis . Your sleep should be as uninterrupted as possible in order to allow your brain to go through adequate amounts of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and one stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep . Your sleep timing should be as consistent as possible. The human body has a natural circadian rhythm with clock genes that dictate your sleep and wakefulness . When you wake up or go to sleep at varying times throughout the week, your body will not operate optimally.<\/p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are several ways to improve your sleep routine . Try to be in bed for at least eight hours in order to get at least seven hours of actual sleep. Try to keep a consistent bedtime and wake-up time everyday. Try to limit caffeine intake at least six hours before going to sleep . Try to eat your last large meal three hours before bed . Turn off all visual or auditory notifications on your electronic devices. Try to stop using any screens at least 1 hour before sleeping . Try reading a book, listening to relaxing music, meditating, breathing, gentle stretching, a hot bath, or a warm cup of tea before turning in (. Try to keep the bedroom as dark as possible and on the cooler side . Try a white noise machine to prevent outside sounds from waking you in the middle of the night. Try to get direct sunlight as soon as you wake up to feel more alert . If none of these options seem to work, you may want to seek professional diagnosis for a sleep disorder such insomnia, restless leg syndrome, or sleep apnea.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nutrient Deficiency<\/h2><br>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel like you get enough high quality uninterrupted sleep, you may want to focus on your nutrition. Vitamins and minerals play an essential role in numerous biological pathways such as energy creation, DNA synthesis, oxygen transport, and neuronal functions . Individuals with low micronutrients such as iron, B vitamins such as B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12, magnesium, and\/or zinc can experience mental and physical fatigue symptoms . If you are curious about your nutrient numbers, you should get a blood test at a medical facility.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The first nutrient you should test for is iron, because iron deficiency can lead to anemia whose primary symptom is fatigue. At risk populations commonly include children, individuals who are menstruating, and those lacking iron in their diet . Iron is essential for creating hemoglobin, which is responsible for transporting oxygen and energy throughout the body. Numerous studies link fatigue with anemia which is characterized by hemoglobin levels below 120 g\/L in women or 130 g\/L in men . If you have low iron, you can eat more red meat, poultry, and seafood for heme iron and fortified grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and vegetables for non-heme iron . If you have been diagnosed as anemic, you should improve your iron levels with a supplement or medical infusions.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all of the B vitamins are involved in at least one and often in several steps of the energy-production system within the cell. When an individual has a significant deficit in any of the B Vitamins, they are likely to experience one of the commonly associated symptoms of fatigue. Here are some examples: lack of thiamine (Vitamin B1) can lead to Beriberi disease. Lack of riboflavin (Vitamin B2) leads to higher risk anemia. Lack of niacin (Vitamin B3) can lead to nonspecific clinical symptoms of fatigue. Lack of pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) can lead to microcytic anemia. Lack of folate (Vitamin B9) can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Lack of cobalamin (Vitamin B12) can result in diminished energy, fatigue, and shortness of breath. At risk populations commonly include older adults, those with anemia, those with gastrointestinal disorders, and vegetarians. If you are low in B vitamins, you can eat more red meat, salmon, organ meat, milk, nutritional yeast, and green leafy vegetables. You can also supplement using a multivitamin, a green powder, or medically given Vitamin B injections.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnesium is involved with multiple cellular functions, including the production and utilization of ATP and neuromuscular coordination. A deficiency in magnesium can cause fatigue, lethargy, and loss of appetite. At risk populations commonly include people with gastrointestinal diseases, type 2 diabetes, and people with alcohol dependence. If you are low in magnesium, you can eat more green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. You can also take a multivitamin, ZMA, or a magnesium only supplement.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinc is involved in many aspects of cellular metabolism, as well as plays a critical part in the antioxidant defense system. Zinc deficiency can affect epidermal, gastrointestinal, central nervous, immune, skeletal, and reproductive systems . At risk populations commonly include people with gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, vegetarians (especially vegans), those who are pregnant or lactating, those with sickle cell disease (SCD), and those with alcohol use disorder . If you have low zinc, you can eat more meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and seafood, especially oysters which contain more zinc per serving than any other food. Zinc can also be found in plants such as beans, nuts, and whole grains but has less bioavailability because of the presence of phytates, which inhibits absorption . You can also take a multivitamin, ZMA, or a zinc only supplement to help boost your numbers.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Stress<\/h2><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Although stress is a natural part of everyday life, chronic stress may lead to fatigue as well as poor mental health, hypertension, depression, burnout, or stress-related exhaustion disorder (24). The worst part is that any of these results can create a negative feedback loop, leading to more stress and more fatigue. When your body experiences persistent surges in your sympathetic nervous system, it can cause chronic inflammation, damages to blood vessels and arteries, increases in blood pressure, and even reductions in brain gray matter volume, all of which can contribute to your fatigue . Sources of stress can include inactivity, relationships, emotional disturbances, traumatic events, location-based stressors, or work.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>If you suffer from chronic stress, you may want to consider some of the following lifestyle changes in order to alleviate some of your stressors. First, you should try to improve your physical health with exercise and diet . Studies have shown a strong bidirectional relationship between physical health and feelings of happiness, more energy, and less stress. Second, you can try some type of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program such as controlled breathing, meditation, yoga, or tai-chi, which have been proven to help reduce stress and fatigue. Third, you may want to try and connect with nature by breathing fresh air, sitting in the sun, walking outside, swimming in the ocean, or perhaps bathing in a hot spring . All of these interventions could help alleviate some of your stressors. Finally, you may want to seek a mental health professional to help with processing any severe emotional problems or traumatic events. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce fatigue severity in chronic fatigue syndrome .<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Tackle your fatigue wherever it lies. The causes of chronic fatigue are often broad and insidious, so sussing them out is no easy task. Still, taking the time to cover all of your bases is the smartest way to conquer this exhaustion. Investigate these potential causes yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out to your medical practitioner.<\/p>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/IFIT%20(3).png?alt=media&token=896c9011-a350-478f-a616-66f652d1f7f5", "note": "It’s normal to feel a general level of tiredness throughout your day so long as you can recover after a good night’s sleep or a restful weekend.

    { "id": "32", "name": "Maximizing Muscle Growth Through Sleep", "description": "<h2>Science &amp; Sleep<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>In order to maximize muscle growth outside of the gym, we need to eat and rest. Sleep is a natural part of our circadian rhythm. We need rest in between days as much as our muscles need rest in between workout sets, as optimal sleep can cause great improvements in muscle recovery and cognitive function.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Little to no sleep has been associated with reduced strength training performance, with one study demonstrating the impairments it has on compound movements. If strength-dominant compound movements are a priority in your workout routine, so should sleep.\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Overnight Muscle Growth<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>During sleep, our bodies shift into a fasted state. The assumption is that our bodies would catabolize during this, but that’s not quite true. Since our heart rate slows down during sleep, we do not use as much energy as we think. Instead, it will rely on pre-stored energy, also known as fat, to remain satiated. If you want to increase muscle overnight, look at what you eat before sleeping. It could help improve overnight muscle-protein synthesis.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Late-night protein intake can help increase muscle mass overnight . Muscle-protein synthesis occurs during sleep. While the body is resting from a day’s work, it’s utilizing this time to repair the body. The recovery of growth hormones can be improved with amino acids. Whole food options such as lean meat and non-fat dairy contain high profiles of these muscle building blocks. As far as supplements (animal and plant-based), check the labels to assure they have the essential amino acids. Including these nutrients in your dinner or nighttime supplements will provide your body with plenty of material to repair itself the way it needs to.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Carbs At Night?<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Carbohydrates play a role in overnight muscle-protein synthesis as well. These foods use insulin to send tryptophan and amino acids towards the brain. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, an essential sleep inducer . However, it is important to combine these carbohydrates with protein, or else tryptophan may not be activated. This combination can also boost cortisol at night which maintains stress and tissue repair.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Sweet Dreams<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Sleep is the most important part of muscle recovery, allowing the body and mind to cool down and maintain its health. As for muscle building, sleep is as important of a practice as exercising and diet. What we eat can change the way we recover overnight, but there is more to it than that. Light exposure can impact sleep rhythms. Dimmed lights and less screen time can contribute to increased levels of serotonin. Vitamins that can improve sleep quality are Vitamin Dand Omega-3’s.

    { "id": "33", "name": "Exercises to Improve Balance", "description": "<p>Balance is needed in every aspect of life. The body can grow imbalances by preferring one side over another. This can even be evident in simple acts like walking. Balance training can improve functional capacity in walking, alongside the many other imbalances . Training for balance can be integrated into one’s routine fairly easily.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Points to Consider<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Proprioception is one’s awareness of movement. One of the biggest proponents to proprioception is sight. This can deceive balance. A lack of proprioception can lead to limited functionality, difficulties in walking, and postural control. To improve balance, gaze at one object while moving.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The foot’s connection to the ground is the root of balance. People do not spend enough time on their feet, nor do not balance properly on them. The Tripod Effect can even out foot placement. Imagine there are three points of the foot to plant on the ground: the heel, big toe, and pinky toe. Shoes that assist in foot placement are flat-footed shoes and soleless shoes. Even exercising without shoes is a popular trend.<\/p>\r\n<p>Even feet is one thing, but uneven ground is another. Equipment that can be helpful in balance training are blocks, boxes, and bosu balls. If those are not available, simply standing on one foot can get the job done.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Standing Balance Exercises<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Balance starts from the feet and travels up the posterior chain. These exercises can develop the body for better balance and posture. The muscles worked for standing balances travel through the feet, calves, hamstrings, hips, and glutes.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Standing balance can be tested through hip contraction and straight-leg extension. Both have a different way of distributing weight throughout the body. Conversely, they recruit different muscles around the posterior chain.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Step Ups<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Arguably the simplest movement on this list, the step-up is as easy as walking up stairs. Many people only use their toes to walk up stairs. For better posterior strength, the entire foot should hit the stair.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Lunges<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n  \r\n     \r\n<p>While lunges can be placed in the anterior muscle category, it can still help with balance. The act of using one side at a time makes it a part of this list. From easiest to hardest, variations include bulgarian split squats, skater squats, and pistol squats.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Jump lunges are a fast-paced way to test balance. Like step-ups, the entire foot should hit the ground before springing back up into the air.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Single-Leg RDL&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p> This may be the toughest balance exercise of the bunch. The weight distribution must be controlled horizontally and vertically. All the while, a weight may be in play. It’s important to avoid hyperextension of the knee and foot imbalances.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Single-Leg Calf Raises<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Calf exercises are often forgotten. The calf muscles are used in everything, especially walking and running. If those are not enough to practice balance, calf raises are a great addition to a routine.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Other Activities<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n  \r\n<p>Walking and climbing stairs are good for lower intensity balance work. Running and jumping rope test balancing at a higher intensity.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Core Balancing Exercises<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Balance stems from the feet and travels towards the core, an essential muscle group connected to everything. From the abdomen to the spine, these movements can contribute to improving one’s overall balance.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Bird-Dog&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p> One of the best functional movements for spinal balancing. The spine connects the lower and upper body. Without a healthy spine, the entire body would be out of balance.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Planks&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>The plank is an essential movement for a stable core. It can recruit any muscle from the feet to the shoulders. The variations involve balancing on one side by lifting one limb off the ground. These include the side plank, one-legged plank, one-arm plank, and awkward plank (opposing arm and leg lifted).<\/p>\r\n<p>Reverse planks are a variation for the posterior chain. Instead of the anterior muscles pushing away from gravity, the posterior chain is resisting it.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p><strong>Single-Leg Glute Bridges<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>This works the same muscles as the standing balance exercises, but is ground-based. It is a hinge movement that works the glutes, core, and hamstrings. The single-leg glute bridge is an alternative to the single-leg RDL.<\/p><br>\r\n<p><strong>Other Activities<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>The core can be recruited in any kind of work. Yoga, kettlebells, and cardio all need it to accomplish the work.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h2>Find your Balance<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Balance is hidden throughout our entire day. Our bodies can speak volumes about how we can correct these imbalances. From sports to daily living, coordination and balance make for a better body.<\/p><br>\r\n ", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%85%20%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%20(5).png?alt=media&token=80b7f4e6-03c7-47e4-9a7a-d772bf58d7a1", "note": "Balance is needed in every aspect of life.

It’s estimated that as many as 70 million Americans suffer from sleep deprivation!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<p>If you make your rest a priority this year, you’ll start seeing changes within a few days and continue to feel better and better all year.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<p>First, start with setting an intention of when you want to be in bed. For example, if you want 8 hours of sleep, and you need to wake up at 6:00, plan to be ready for sleep by 10:00. This means you’ll want to start getting ready for bed by 9:00. Then, set yourself up for success by backing into the rest of your schedule so it will support your bedtime intention.&nbsp;<\/p><br>\r\n<p>You can increase your chances of restful sleep by exercising regularly. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, 30 minutes of daily moderate aerobic exercise increases the amount of deep sleep you’ll get. This is the level of sleep where your brain and body rejuvenate themselves. To greatly increase your physical restoration during that deep sleep, I recommend drinking RSP Nutrition’s AminoLean Recovery before getting a good night's sleep on exercise days to help expedite your muscles’ repair and growth. You’ll also have the added benefits of boosting immunity and hydration from the supplement.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>It will also be important to establish a bedtime routine. Start getting ready at least an hour before lights out.

    { "id": "36", "name": "3 Reasons Why You Should Eliminate Rest Days", "description": "<p>I'm a firm believer of whole-body training, and when it comes to better results, I believe it's important to train seven days a week.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Now, there's no reason to worry about overtraining, because the human body is designed to work every day without rest. With the right full-body training program, you can safely work your entire body—every day—without injury.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>Below are three reasons why I believe eliminating rest days will improve your training results.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Reason 1: Better Fat Burning<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Now, it's obvious that the more work you do, the more calories you burn, and therefore the more fat you lose. However, there's another trick resistance training has up its sleeve, and that's activating metabolic genes in muscle fibers.<\/p>\r\n <img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up lazyloaded\" alt=\"Better Fat Burning \" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-1-700xh.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-1-700xh.png\"> \r\n<br>\r\n<p>When you train your muscles daily with weights, you activate these metabolic genes in those muscle fibers each and every day. This keeps those genes turned on and activated, so you end up burning even more fat every single day.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3><strong>Reason 2: Better Muscle Growth<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>The research actually shows that with full-body training and training every muscle group each and every day, muscle growth and strength may be improved. This goes back to that same gene activation in the muscle fibers.<\/p><br>\r\n <img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" alt=\"Better Muscle Growth\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-2-700xh.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-2-700xh.png\"> \r\n<br>\r\n<p>Activating genes involved in muscle growth and synthesis each and every day through resistance training keeps those processes of protein synthesis turned on, which can lead to greater gains in both muscle size and strength. By never taking a day off, those synthesizing processes stay turned on.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3><strong>Reason 3: Better Overall Health<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Once again, the key to better overall health may lie in daily gene activation through exercise. Those genes that are involved in metabolism are also involved in health outcomes. Activating those metabolic genes each and every day through daily training may help promote longevity, while lowering the risk of diseases such as depression, heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes.<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"bbcmsCaptionedImage__wrapper\"><img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" alt=\"Better Overall Health\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-3-700xh.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2018\/april\/3-reasons-why-you-should-eliminate-rest-days-jym-3-700xh.png\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are my three reasons why you should eliminate rest days.

    { "id": "37", "name": "Stay Motivated to Keep Training", "description": "<p>Mental fatigue lies at the core of motivating yourself to hit the gym and push hard at every workout. The way the brain and body are interconnected suggests that the brain influences many markers of physical performance, including power, muscular endurance, reaction time, and processing speed. Even the motivation to train is governed by mental energy.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Our goal here is to focus on mental fatigue, how scientists believe the brain is operating through fatigue, and how you can harness willpower and strengthen your self-control to combat fatigue and follow through on a workout program.<\/p><br>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Understanding the Causes of Mental Fatigue<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>It makes sense that mental fatigue would influence metrics like reaction time, processing speed, and focus. More surprising is that it can decrease endurance and strength performance. In a study conducted at Michigan Technological University, when participants were given mentally fatiguing questions while <em>in<\/em> the process of working out, strength performance decreased by 10-66 percent and endurance performance by 25 percent.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>A 2017 review of 11 studies analyzing mental fatigue and physical performance confirmed those results. The authors identified \"higher than normal perceived exertion\" as the culprit that was hurting endurance performance.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>There are two potential explanations for why this happens. One is that the more mentally tired you are, the higher the signaling rate, which is how much the brain talks to the muscles in order for them to perform. It makes you feel that you have to work harder physically.<\/p><br>\r\n<img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up lazyloaded\" alt=\"Exerting energy during workout. \" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-1-700xh.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-1-700xh.jpg\"><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The other hypothesis is that the brain processes effort differently when it is suffering from mental fatigue, which makes the workout seem more difficult than it actually is.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>For example, when the sensation of fatigue—burning legs, wheezing lungs—is amplified, the brain decides \"this is enough,\" and exhaustion sets in. You may be physiologically fine and your body may be capable of doing much more, yet you are mentally unable to go further.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3><strong>Two Models of Mental Fatigue<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>There are two main models of mental fatigue: the central governor model and the psychobiological model.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The central governor model suggests that the brain regulates physical exertion, controlling output so you cannot threaten the body's safe homeostasis. This is a top-down theory: The brain keeps you safe from harm but does it subconsciously.<\/p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In the psychobiological model, theorists observe that people exercise until they experience high levels of perceived effort, and they stop exercise without actually getting to physiological failure, often because they believe the task is physically impossible. This is done at a conscious level, as it relates to perception.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Both are important, though theoretical, models of mental fatigue. While they disagree on some aspects of how and why, they agree on the big picture: Increased mental fatigue results in decreased athletic performance.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h3><strong>The Science of Willpower<\/strong><\/h3><br> \r\n<p>Your ability to maintain self-control and actually work out, finish the workout, and train to physical exhaustion is a huge determining factor in your success. It may also be a finite resource.<\/p><br>\r\n <img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up lazyload\" alt=\"A scientist studying body composition. \" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-2-35x35.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-2-700xh.jpg\"> <br>\r\n\r\n<p>According to researcher Roy Baumeister, willpower and self-control are limited. In 1998 he coined the term \"ego depletion,\" which suggests that self-control wanes over time. This gave rise to the idea that willpower may be like a reservoir. Each act of self-control taps into the reservoir, which leaves less self-control available for other things that require it.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>People have a hard time maintaining self-control over long stretches of time. Many people join a gym or start an exercise program in January and find themselves skipping workouts by February. But depleting willpower doesn't just occur over weeks or months. It can play out over the course of a day; for example, someone who seldom eats junk food, but when they do, it is in the evening and at night. Their self-control, which has been exerted all day, starts to fail in the evening; their self-control reservoir is drained, and there's nothing left to counter temptation.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Another model of motivation, the self-determination theory, builds on the idea of willpower being a finite resource.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>In 2007, researchers Richard Ryan and Edward Deci stated that ego depletion is more nuanced than Baumeister suggests. Focusing on \"vitality,\" a term they use for physical and mental energy, they propose that the degree of depletion of vitality and energy is determined by the source of motivation for the behavior. In other words, the key is the why of what you are doing. According to Ryan and Deci, intrinsic motivation (being the best version of yourself, having self-respect) doesn't deplete your willpower nearly as much as extrinsic motivation (how you look, what someone said about your body). You can create deeper willpower reservoirs by focusing on intrinsic motivation.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<h3><strong>Tips for Gaining Workout Motivation<\/strong><\/h3><br>\r\n<p>While supplements like nootropics and ergogenics can improve physical performance , there are strategies you can use to get that extra push to fight mental fatigue and support your willpower without supplements.*<\/p><br>\r\n<p>For one thing, shorter, higher-intensity workouts don't require as much mental energy as longer workouts. You can minimize the effect of mental fatigue on exercise performance by the type of exercise you do; for example, high-intensity interval training, which is high-intensity, low-duration activity.<\/p><br>\r\n<div class=\"bbcmsCaptionedImage__wrapper\"><img class=\"bbCaptionedImage blur-up lazyload\" alt=\"At the starting line for sprints. \" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-3-35x35.jpg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/images\/2020\/october\/stay-motivated-to-keep-training-3-700xh.jpg\"><\/div><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option if you are short on time is to do sprints for 4 minutes. You do eight sprints, all out, for 20 seconds, with 10 seconds of rest between sprints. It can be an incredibly challenging workout in less than 5 minutes.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>You can also do things during the workday to keep mental fatigue in check. This is especially important if you plan to exercise after work. Having more mental energy available at the end of the day can improve your workout and may even make a difference in whether you make it to the gym at all.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Performance consultant Angie Fifer, Ph.D., suggests taking short breaks throughout the day and that you \"focus intensely for 20 minutes with a 5-minute break.\" A 2011 study published in the journal Cognition confirms that brief mental breaks slow mental fatigue.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>When taking a short break, try doing something different from your work. In other words, don't take a break from working at a computer by looking at a smartphone. Better to go for a short walk outside.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p><em>*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

    { "id": "38", "name": "The Top 5 Exercises For Increasing Forearm Mass", "description": "<h2>Forearm Anatomy<\/h2>\r\n<p>The primary movers of the forearm muscles are the flexors and extensors. The muscles are used to strengthen the wrists and grip in the hands, improving your capacity for daily living through lifting bags and other objects.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The forearm contains a number of small as well as lengthy muscles, including the flexors and extensors, pronators and supinators. Each of these muscles is responsible for the combined movement of the hand and wrist.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2 class=\"bordered\">\r\nThe Top 5 Exercises for Increasing Forearms<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>There are any number of exercises that can help you focus your forearms to increase the overall strength of these muscle groups. These exercise target the specialized muscles of the forearm.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The top 5 forearm exercises have been put together to eliminate a lot of time and wasted energy on ineffective workouts. These workouts will focus on minimal movement while maximizing the focus.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>\r\n1. Barbell Wrist Curls<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Like many of the top 5 forearm exercises listed here, the barbell wrist curl is an extremely effective workout that targets the flexor muscles of the forearm. It can be done using an appropriate machine or a weighted barbell.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Sit on a bench or at the machine. Rest your forearms on your thighs with palms up as you hold the barbell. Using only your hands and your wrists you will curl the barbell up toward the ceiling as high as you can lift. When you lower the barbell under control, allow it to roll into the nook of your fingertips.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>\r\n2. Barbell Reverse Wrist Curls<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>The barbell reverse wrist curl is a very similar motion to the common barbell curl listed above, and focuses primarily on the forearm extensor muscles.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>To perform this workout you will need to take a seat at a bunch or at the appropriate weight machine. Lay your forearms on your lap while you hold the weighted barbell (or empty barbell) with your palms facing down. Using only the muscles in your wrists and forearm, curl the weight upward as high as you can go while keeping your forearms flat on your lap. Lower the barbell under control as far as you’re able to go and then repeat.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>\r\n3. Dumbbell Wrist Curl<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>This is one of the top forearm exercises that is absolutely great for the forearm flexors. This motion allows you to work each forearm individually. By working with the individual weights, you’re able to establish a greater sense of balance.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>To perform this top forearm exercise you’ll need to straddle a bench and hold the  dumbbell with an underhand grip. Spread your legs and rest your forearm on the bench so that it’s extending beyond the end of the long bench. Allow the dumbbell to drop so that it rolls into your fingertips. Grip the weight and flex your wrist to bring the dumbbell back up to a starting position.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>\r\n4. Dumbbell Reverse Wrist Curl<\/h3>\r\n<p>Redundancy is never an issue when you have a variety of muscles to train. While these workouts may seem similar to another, the change in position completely changes the targeted muscle group. The reverse wrist curl targets the bulk of the extensors. Again, when you work with the individual weights you’re able to individually target the muscle groups of the arms. The individual workouts from one side to another will help stimulate balance and proportion between your forearms.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>For this top forearm exercise you need to straddle a bench and hold your dumbbell with an overhand grip. Lean forward and rest your forearm on the bench at a bent, 90 degree angle. With this angle you’ll be holding the dumbbell weight off the side of the bench with your palm facing the floor. Lower the dumbbell as far as you can and the reverse the motion to bring the weight back up as far you can while flexing the wrist. Once your reps are complete, switch arms and repeat the process.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3><br>\r\n5. Reverse Barbell Curls<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>Unlike the other top forearm exercises, the reverse barbell curl actually diverts some of the attention to the biceps however it does specifically target the forearm extensor muscles through the lifting process. This is an excellent workout if you want to take some emphasis off the forearm muscle groups to blend maneuvers into a whole body workout – perhaps to give your forearm a bit of a rest.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>To perform this workout, grip a barbell (some prefer an EZ curl barbell for added wrist comfort) so that your hands are shoulder width apart, palms to the floor (overhand grip). Standing straight, you will keep your back flat and your chin up. Tuck your elbows into your sides and curl the bar upwards towards your clavicle area (upper chest, neck). Hold the lift and flex the forearm muscles then lower the barbell under control.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Remember to keep your arms tucked into your sides.

    { "id": "39", "name": "The Top 5 Exercises For Increasing Back Mass", "description": "<p>If you are one of those people who only like to work out your “Show Muscles” (chest, arms, abs and some shoulders) then move on, but if you are looking to have a thick, dense and well balanced upper body then stick around. I am going to discuss how to turn your <em>Baby Back<\/em> into <em>Wide Thick Wings of Muscle<\/em>.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>The torso is the focal core of the body. Not only does it house the most vital organs of our body but it also provides the bulk of the support and strength we need to function through the day, no matter how small the movement. If you continue to work your back, you can guarantee that you’ll have balanced and strong muscles to support you. With stronger back muscles with these top 5 exercises you’ll be able to:<\/p><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Handle heavier weights from a deadlift at floor level.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Increase the rate and amount of calorie burn through standard lifting and exercise.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Easily move your body through motions that require you to lift and move your own weight.<\/li><br>\r\n<li>Provide strength and balance to your spine, protecting your body from injury when moving and lifting.<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Back Anatomy<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Knowing the muscles you’re about to work on can be extremely beneficial. Next to the legs, the back contains the highest concentration of muscles in the body and for good reason. The back supports the function and movement of all of your limbs and has a wide range of jobs that it needs to perform on a routine basis.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>Lower Back (Lower Trapezius)<\/h3><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Function<\/strong>: Depression of the scapula.<\/li><br>\r\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: From the scapula all the way down to the top of the buttocks – or basically the lower portion of the back around the spine.<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Middle Back (Rhomboids)<\/h3><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Function<\/strong>: Retracts the scapula, downward rotation of the scapula.<\/li><br>\r\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Connected to both the scapula and the spinal column in the middle of the back.<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Lats (Latissimus Dorsi)<\/h3><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Function<\/strong>: Extension, adduction, medial rotation.<\/li><br>\r\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Inserts in the lower 6 thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Also inserts in the middle side of the arm pit area (humerous).<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Traps (Trapezius)<\/h3><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Function<\/strong>: Elevation of the scapula, adduction of the scapula, depression of the scapula.<\/li><br>\r\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Insets at the top of the neck travels all the way down the spine and inserts just about the buttocks.<\/li><br>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>The Top 5 Exercises for Increasing Back Muscles<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Most exercises, such as those previously listed in past articles, will combine some measure of work on the back muscles. Few exercises target only the back muscles, so its important to keep in mind that when you develop your workout to engage your back muscles you’ll also be working muscles within the extremities that may already be strained during previous exercises. Plan your workout accordingly.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>1. Bent Over Rows<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>I’ve targeted this exercise before for other muscle groups but it needs to be noted that it is likely the most appropriate workout for pushing the mass of the upper body. Each of the primary muscle groups of the back will be utilized in the bent over row provided you utilize proper form with a weighted barbell.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>To start, stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees slightly and keep your head up. Bend so that you are almost but not quite parallel to the floor. Let the weight hand straight down directly below your chest. Your palms should be facing toward you as you lift the weight. Use your back muscles to draw the weight up to touch your chest while keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body. Lower the weight under control and repeat.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>2. Pull ups and Chin Ups<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>This may seem like an exercise that’s more appropriate for the arms but a great deal of work is placed on the upper back to lift the weight of the body and lower it under control. This exercise is a true measure of strength and a hefty challenge simply because you’re lifting your full body weight. An alternative for beginner would be to use a assisted pull-up machine which uses weight to counter act your own bodyweight.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Use this machine until you can perform regular pull-up\/chin-ups in proper form<\/p>\r\n<p>Because of the position of the grip, pull ups can often be a little more difficult than chin ups. Either way, start with a bar and jump up to reach the bar. Go palms down (away from you) for pull ups and palms up (facing you) for chin ups. Keep your hands at shoulder width approximately for pull ups and just to the outside of the width of the jawline for chin ups.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>3. Barbell Shrugs<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>This is a very focused workout that targets only the traps. You’re providing no additional workout to any other muscle group in the upper back, so keep that in mind as you rotate your exercises. Depending on the scale of your workout, you can usually dish on a lot of weight when working your traps – just keep your workout appropriately balanced.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>To set this exercise up, use a weighted barbell and set it up at thigh height from an adjustable rack. Let the weight hang at your thighs with arms fully extended. Keep your back straight, chin up and try to shrug your shoulders as high as you can. Raise the weight as you do so, pausing for a few seconds at the height of the shrug. Lower the weight under control and repeat. Alternately, you can also use dumbbells to perform shrugs but you won’t get anywhere near the same weight on individual barbells.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>4. Single Arm Dumbbell Row<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>This exercise provides a much fuller contraction over a greater range of motion as compared to barbell rows. This is also an ideal way to isolate and focus on each side of your back, resting one as your motor through working the other.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Use a bench to kneel, supporting yourself with your free hand on the bench. Move so that your torso is parallel to the floor. Let the dumbbell hang with your arm extended. Draw the weight to touch your chest, palms facing your body while keeping your elbows tucked firmly in. Release the weight and extend your arm under control. Your body angle, grip and weight will change the degree and difficulty of this top back exercise.<\/p><br>\r\n<h3>5. Barbell Deadlifts<\/h3><br>\r\n<p>The deadlift is a widely popular exercise and for good reason. It’s a part of every serious weight training program because it requires the majority of the body – including the muscles of the back – to work in conjunction for the perfect lift workout. The only other exercise that’s more effective at building solid muscle and burning calories is the power squat.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>It’s important to note that while this exercise targets the back muscles for stability, you are not lifting with your back. To perform the deadlift, stand with feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees and reach down to grab the bar. With heavy lifting, keep your hands opposite with one facing in and the other facing out. When you lift, lift the weight with your legs, focusing the push in your glutes, hips and the rest of the leg muscle groups. Keep your back straight and stand up straight, keeping your arms fully extended down with the weight close to the body.&nbsp; When you rise fully, hold the weight and lower it again under control.<\/p><br>\r\n <hr><br>\r\n<p>You’ll see the best results by adding the top exercises to build your back to your usual workout routine. When working on increasing muscle mass in back, remember that it’s important to take in the proper amount of nutrients and protein to sustain your exercises.<\/p> <br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%85%20%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%20(6).png?alt=media&token=ebd81ea2-d8d2-4711-b323-bb7607be32e8", "note": "If you are one of those people who only like to work out your “Show Muscles” (chest, arms, abs and some shoulders) then move on, but if you are looking to.......", "created_at": "2024-04-28 08:47:05", "updated_at": "2024-04-28 08:47:05" },
    { "id": "40", "name": "Creative Ways to Fit In Cardio", "description": "<p>Cardio heals the heart in a multitude of ways. From the benefits of bodily function to the improved quality of life , cardio is an opportunity for growth. The questions arise: where do I start? Or… what do I do next? Cardio can be intimidating because of the overabundance of choices (and sweat), but it does not have to be. Cardio can be achieved by anyone through various intensities and activities.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Switch It Up<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Routines can be good for people who crave structure, but it’s easy to get comfortable with a routine. Breaking the traditions can actually bring growth because it shocks the body. The surprise will increase heart rate, amping up the work of the sympathetic nervous system , which is a natural occurrence in cardio. The shock forces the body to focus more on the breath as it adapts to new movements and situations. Not only is the heart going to benefit from it, but it adds variety to the body’s skills.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The surprising bursts of shock can be implemented in any kind of exercise, even weightlifters. The use of shock can be used outside of volume structures and supersets. Some people do cardio at the start, end, or at both of their exercises. Now is the chance to jump into a cardio session in the middle of a workout, too. It could be jumping rope, box jumps, or a high-intensity interval training session. Any cardio option will promote muscular growth because of the shock.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>For athletes outside of the gym, there’re options to switch up the usual training routine. If training for endurance, consider taking a different route with higher inclines or build up the motivation to sprint for a few seconds. Another alternative is to try shorter daily doses of cardio instead of a handful of longer sessions per week.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>If the usual go-to cardio sessions are getting boring, perhaps it’s time to change when or what is being worked. Meanwhile, switching up the environment can be creative as well.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Step Outside<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>There’s more to cardio than what’s inside the gym. A change in the environment can change cardiovascular performance. Gyms tend to have regulated temperatures to keep customers comfortable. Instead of exercising indoors, take a step outside! The environmental impact can heat up the body temperature in the summer or freeze the lungs in the winter. Either way, it becomes a new challenge for cardiovascular performance and willpower. Let’s not forget the sun exposure for Vitamin D either.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>People who participate in outdoor activities have higher cognitive function and reaction times than those who practice indoors . Whether it’s from the comradery of a sports team or the relief of the atmosphere’s fresh air, it’s more beneficial than getting the heart rate up indoors. If the gym is not inspiring enough, the great outdoors can bring in a new light to cardio.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, individual activities such as swimming and walking can further connect us to nature. The change in landscapes may cause us to slow down and take in the world around us.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Slow It Down<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Sometimes, slowing down can bring massive improvements. The body can move so fast that it forgets to connect with the mind and heart. One way to balance heart health is to manage heart rate variability. While high-intensity training stresses the sympathetic nervous system, low-intensity activity stimulates the parasympathetic system. These activities will maintain the body’s sensory functions rooted in the vagus nerve, the main parasympathetic nerve .<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p>Parasympathetic activity can be achieved by slow and deep breathing. This has been shown to improve heart health by reducing anxiety in both younger and older groups alike . Mindful walks outside, holistic yoga flows, and  meditation contribute to the function of the parasympathetic nervous system. The focus of these rely on the pace of the heart, trying to keep it as slow as possible through the breath. If anything, this qualifies as cardio because it involves managing BPM (beats per minute) through activity. If slowing down is an issue, this can be the right step forward.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Cardio On<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Cardio seems like an intimidating word. However, it does not have to be achieved only in the gym and is not only delegated to athletes. Anyone who has an aspiration for a healthier life can achieve it. There are many ways to achieve it at any pace and any environment. Cardio should be joyful and motivating enough to keep practicing it. How will you get creative with cardio?<\/p><br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/chest%2Fcreative-ways-to-fit-in-cardio-header-830x467.jpg?alt=media&token=4986b9e2-f6d2-495a-bd7e-3a1329080d05", "note": "Cardio heals the heart in a multitude of ways.

    { "id": "41", "name": "Best Foods for Gaining Muscle", "description": "<p>Muscle growth is no easy task. It is a long process that involves consistent bouts of intense resistance training over the course of many weeks, paired with a consistent caloric surplus. Lifters often find that the latter element is the more difficult part of the bulking journey. To help make things easier, we’ve compiled some of the best macronutrient sources to include in your meal plan. These foods are some of the most reliable for adding lean muscle and increasing exercise performance. Get your diet in top shape, and let the muscle mass roll in.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>High calorie sources<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Now, we’re sure you’ve probably heard the old adage of calories in calories out. This is spouted as fitness gospel all around, but mainly because it’s simple, and it works. Muscle gain requires the body to be in a caloric surplus, which requires a lot of food for some. Eating your bodyweight in red meat or other animal protein sources isn’t going to be the most optimal way of getting this done though. Focusing on calorie-dense options will make this whole journey that much easier, keeping your body in an anabolic state.<\/p>\r\n <br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Muscle building foods<\/h2><br>\r\n<p><strong>Protein power<\/strong> (.7-1 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight to make sure you’re getting enough protein)<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Adequate protein intake is necessary as protein is the building block of muscle. Whole eggs mixed with egg whites for extra protein are a great option. They are also naturally high in anabolism-inducing leucine. Greek yogurt is another solid option, especially with toppings such as granola or magnesium rich chia seeds to add calories. This also works to add micronutrients such as calcium and probiotics. This is great to time right before bed as well, since it is mostly comprised of slow absorbing casein protein.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Quinoa, legumes, lentils, or chickpeas are great for vegetarian sources of protein. Plant-based protein shakes are another invaluable option. Soy protein or pea protein are two common types.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>While protein is invaluable for muscle growth, it also has the tendency to induce satiety. This makes it more difficult to eat enough, so we recommend centering your protein mainly post-workout. Lean mass requires protein, so get it in how you can.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Healthy fats<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Peanut butter is the premier bulking food. It is extremely calorically dense, containing 100 calories per tablespoon. It can be easily enjoyed as a spread, with calorie dense and potassium rich bananas, or included in smoothies.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Olive oil is another healthy fat that brings upon much needed calories. It can be drizzled on a salad as a nutritious dressing or used in cooking.<\/p><br>\r\n \r\n<p><strong>Carbohydrates<\/strong><\/p><br>\r\n<p>Whole grains are your best bet when trying to maximize the health benefits of carbs. They are best timed before and after workout to get the most out of performance.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sweet potatoes are full of carbs and calories yet retain great health benefits, including rich b vitamins.<\/p><br>\r\n<p>Brown rice is another great carb source. It can be easily added to nearly any dish, adding calories and sustained energy.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Supplements<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Whey protein shakes, some marketed as mass gainers, are the most obvious bodybuilding boosters. High-quality protein powder is often necessary for athletic performance. Dietary protein is difficult to fit in, so utilizing supplements as part of a balanced diet is a great way to ensure your muscle tissue is being maximally fueled. Having a solid creatine monohydrate is also great to support muscle protein synthesis. Essential amino acids are another great supplement to round out muscle recovery.<\/p><br>\r\n<h2>Going Forward<\/h2><br>\r\n<p>Keeping your calories high yet maintaining good nutrition is a tough balance. Thankfully, it is not an impossible one. Try including some of the foods from this list into your diet, but most importantly, find what works right for you and your goals. Go forth and build muscle with confidence.<\/p><br>", "image": "https:\/\/firebasestorage.googleapis.com\/v0\/b\/gym-app-c977e.appspot.com\/o\/IFIT%20(5).png?alt=media&token=dcfcf8ee-6213-4e00-a76a-cca43a66964c", "note": "Muscle growth is no easy task.
