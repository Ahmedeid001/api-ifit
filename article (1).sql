(17, 'Hypertrophy Training', '1. Mechanical Tension\r\n\r\nMuscle growth hinges on the tension created during resistance training. This tension, a signal for muscles to grow, is crucial across all hypertrophy exercises. To maximize it, focus on lifting weights in a way that challenges the muscles through both the amount lifted and the technique used.\r\n\r\nMaximizing Muscle Tension: Achieved by challenging muscles with the weight and lifting method.\r\n\r\n2. Technique\r\n\r\nCorrect technique is vital for applying tension to the intended muscles. Key aspects include:\r\n\r\nControlling the Negative: Emphasize a slower descent to make the eccentric phase more effective for growth. Avoid letting weights drop quickly. Aim for a controlled 1-2 second negative in every exercise.\r\nRange of Motion: Full movement is encouraged in each exercise, supporting both hypertrophy and functionality. Avoid shortcuts like incomplete lockouts to maintain and improve functionality.\r\nConsistent Form: Keep your form steady, especially when increasing weights or reps. Altering form to lift more can hinder targeted muscle tension. Prioritize technique over lifting heavier.\r\n\r\n3. Effort and Intensity\r\n\r\nTo get the most benefit out of strength and hypertrophy progressions, you have to push to, or near failure on your last (if you are new to this type of training) or last two (if more experienced) sets of each exercise. This approach, which involves performing reps until proper form can’t be maintained, has been found to be one of the single best factors for promoting muscle growth, according to recent studies.\r\n\r\n4. Progressive Overload \r\n\r\nProgressive overload involves gradually increasing the stress placed on your body during exercise training. This can be done by adding more weight, increasing the frequency of workouts, or doing more repetitions in strength training. This gradual progression leads to continuous improvement and adaptation. This principle is key to ongoing muscle development and adaptation.', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/february/how-to-best-shake-up-your-gym-routine-header-400x2', NULL, NULL),
(18, 'Reps in Reserve', 'What does RIR (Reps In Reserve) mean?\r\nRIR means “Reps in Reserve” = how many more reps could you do before muscular failure.\r\n\r\n3+ RIR (or RPE < 7) = More than 3 Reps In Reserve = more than 3 repetitions away from failure\r\n3 RIR (or RPE 7) = 3 Reps In Reserve = 3 repetitions away from failure\r\n2 RIR (or RPE 8) = 2 Reps In Reserve = 2 repetitions away from failure\r\n1 RIR (or RPE 9) = 1 Rep In Reserve = 1 repetitions away from failure\r\n0 RIR (or RPE 10) = 0 Reps In Reserve = 0 repetitions away from failure/max effort \r\n\r\nThis concept is closely related to the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), a scale introduced by Gunnar Borg and later adapted for strength training by Mike Tuchscherer. RPE assesses effort and fatigue, where an RPE of 8 equates to 2 RIR, indicating two reps could be performed before failure.\r\n\r\nWhy RIR Matters?\r\n\r\nProgressive Overload: Central to strength training, progressive overload necessitates continuously challenging your muscles to ensure ongoing growth and improvements. RIR facilitates this by helping you gauge the right weight that offers a challenge without leading to overexertion.\r\nFatigue Management: Training to complete muscle failure in every set can quickly deplete your energy reserves and negatively impact your performance in subsequent sets or workouts. RIR allows for a more sustainable approach, helping maintain energy levels and performance consistency across your training sessions.\r\nInjury Prevention: Pushing to failure increases the risk of compromising form, potentially leading to injuries. By incorporating RIR, you’re more likely to maintain proper technique throughout each exercise, significantly reducing the risk of injury.\r\nTraining Longevity: Consistently training at or near failure can lead to burnout and overtraining, hindering long-term progress. RIR supports sustained progress by preventing excessive fatigue and promoting recovery.\r\n\r\nImplementing RIR in Your Training\r\nIncorporating RIR into your routine is straightforward:\r\n\r\nDetermine Your RIR: Decide how many reps you want to leave in reserve. This might vary based on your training phase, goals, and the specific exercise.\r\nSelect Appropriate Weights: Choose weights that allow you to reach the desired RIR. This might require some experimentation and adjustments.\r\nMonitor Your Progress: Keep track of the weights you’re lifting and the corresponding RIR to ensure continuous progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion Reps in Reserve is a powerful concept in strength training that prioritizes intelligent effort over maximal exertion. It champions the idea that stopping short of failure can lead to better gains, longer training careers, and fewer injuries. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced athlete, incorporating RIR into your training regimen can significantly enhance your strength training efficacy and enjoyment.', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/july/why-low-grip-strength-can-affect-your-overall-health-h', NULL, NULL),
(19, 'Energy Systems Training', 'Understanding the energy systems in the body is crucial for effective training. Our program integrates workouts that tap into various energy pathways to ensure a comprehensive approach to fitness. It’s important to note that these systems often overlap during exercises, offering a nuanced and well-rounded training regimen. Here, we delve into each energy system and provide examples of workouts that predominantly utilize them:\r\n\r\n1. Anaerobic Alactic or Phosphocreatine System (ATP-PC)\r\nThis energy system is activated during short, high-intensity activities lasting about 10-15 seconds. It provides a quick burst of energy, making it essential for power-based workouts. Here are some basic examples of exercises that predominantly tap into this system:\r\n\r\nSprint: A 100m dash where you give your maximum effort.\r\nHeavy Lifting: Lifting a heavy weight for 1-3 repetitions, like a max effort deadlift or squat.\r\nJumping: Performing high-intensity jumps, like box jumps or broad jumps, in quick succession.\r\nThrowing: Activities like medicine ball throws where maximum power is required for a short duration.\r\nShort Duration Rowing or Cycling: Going all out for a 15-second row or cycle sprint.\r\n\r\n2. Anaerobic Lactic or Glycolytic System\r\nThis system comes into play for activities that last about 30 seconds to 2 minutes, providing energy through the breakdown of carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. It is utilized in high-intensity, short-duration workouts. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n400m Run: A middle-distance run where you maintain a high intensity throughout.\r\nCircuit Training: A circuit of exercises performed back-to-back with little to no rest, lasting for around a minute.\r\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): Workouts where you perform exercises at a high intensity for intervals lasting up to 2 minutes.\r\nComplex Lifts: Performing a series of complex lifts continuously for a minute or two.\r\nBurpees: Doing a set of burpees at a fast pace for a minute.\r\n3. Aerobic System\r\nThe aerobic system is the dominant energy system for activities lasting longer than 2 minutes. It utilizes oxygen to generate energy from carbohydrates and fats. This system is essential for endurance and long-duration activities. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\nLong-Distance Running: Engaging in a 5k or 10k run where you maintain a steady pace.\r\nCycling: Going for a long bike ride at a moderate pace.\r\nSwimming: Swimming laps continuously for an extended period.\r\nRowing: Engaging in a long-duration rowing session at a moderate intensity.\r\nAMRAP Workouts: Workouts where you perform as many rounds as possible of a series of exercises in a given time frame, usually lasting 20 or more minutes.\r\n\r\nOur approach\r\n\r\nThe goal of our training program is to have members spend the most of their training within the aerobic system range, often touching but never crossing the lactic threshold. Aerobic system training is proven to be the most beneficial for longevity and overall health. The way you approach your workouts, such as your pacing strategy and not the workout itself will often dictate which energy system is predominatly used. For more information on how we expect the conditioning workouts in our program to be executed please refer to this article.\r\n\r\nBy understanding these energy systems and how they overlap in various exercises, you can better plan your workouts, pacing yourself appropriately and choosing the right intensity to achieve your fitness goals', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/april/lifting-for-strength-vs-hypertrophy-vs-endurance-head', NULL, NULL),
(20, '5 Biggest Mistakes People Make in the Gym', '1. Going In Without A Plan\r\nBy far, the number one mistake of gym goers is moseying into the iron temple not having a clue of what they are about to do. This is forgivable once in a while, but consistently showing up with a lackadaisical attitude and no general objective for the session will eventually come back to haunt you. Do yourself a favor and get equipped with a basic training program that will give you more structure and consistency-- it doesn’t have to be anything fancy! \r\n\r\n2. Skipping The Warm-Up\r\nTons of people walk right into the gym and head straight to the squat rack. That may work for some people, but the majority of the population needs some sort of warm-up protocol to prepare their tissues and their minds for the training session. This is going to look different for everyone, but a good place to start is a quick 3-5 minutes of general cardiovascular exercise to increase blood flow, followed by a relevant mobility flow to address any joint stiffness that could impede movement efficiency during the workout. \r\n\r\n3. Changing Your Exercises Too Frequently\r\nThe concept of “muscle confusion” has been debunked time after time. In order to strengthen or grow a body part we need consistent and targeted stimulus. That alone requires practice; to get better at a movement and really dial in your mind muscle connection you need to repeatedly practice it so you can recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and really squeeze the juice out of the exercise.\r\n\r\n4. Ignoring What You Do With The Other 23 Hours Of Your Day\r\nThis one might hit pretty close to home, as it is the stem of the frustration of many gym goers. Going to the gym for an hour a day is not enough to make up for a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. Make sure the other 23 hours in your day reflect your goals just as much as that one hour banging weights does. This applies to your recovery, diet, sleep, social life etc.\r\n\r\n5. Thinking Everyone Is Looking At You \r\nLast but not least, this one is huge. Gym anxiety can be paralyzing, especially for people who are new to training. As much as I can sit here and yell at you NO ONE CARES!, I know it’s easier said than done to ignore that part of your brain that tells you everyone is watching you. The only way to get over that barrier is to face it head-on. The more frequently you expose yourself to that uncomfortable situation of being in the gym, the easier it gets. You just have to get some momentum and allow yourself to form a callus over that fear with time.

(21, 'How & When To Use a Weightlifting Belt', 'Why The Belt?\r\nThe weightlifting belt is one of the most crucial pieces of equipment in heavy lifting. For competitors and amateurs alike, this can preserve the health of your spine while working with heavy loads. However, there’s more to it than just strapping it around your stomach and expecting heavier lifts. The belt has its time and a place in your workout. When used right, the belt can improve your performance in compound lifts and the strength of your core.\r\n\r\nHow To Use It..!\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the belt is put around the core and above the hip bones. The weightlifting belt will not be strapped in the same spot for everybody. It’s a piece of equipment that takes practice through trial and error in order to find how it can be most effective. For example, the deadlift mechanics may require a different height for the belt than the overhead press. What matters most is how it can be used to brace the body for compound muscle recruitment.\r\n\r\nThe most important muscles for the belt are in the core and the glutes. A lifting belt reduces spinal shrinkage during compound exercises. As a result, it can stabilize the lower back and glutes during functional loading. This is great for anyone who experiences low-back pain, because it is almost always caused by weak glutes and hamstrings.\r\n\r\nThe tightness of the belt takes practice too. Lifting with a belt requires different muscle recruitment in the core. Some athletes are trained to brace their core inwards while exercising. The belt requires outward flexion instead, as if the core is bracing for a gut punch. It’s important that the belt should not constrict air flow so it can brace the core outward. If lifters are using a belt for the first time, finding the proper buckle is the first learning curve that needs adjusting. There are some breathing techniques such as the Valsalva maneuver that help with this core engagement .\r\n\r\nWhen To Use It...! \r\n\r\nBelts are most effective during compound exercises in which one is one their feet. These exercises are also closed-chain movements which require abdominal pressure, hence the belt. They should not be worn for extension or supine movements. Belts come into use for barbell versions of the deadlift, squat, clean, snatch, and the overhead press. A lifting belt has especially been shown to have a positive effect on exertion in deadlifts .\r\n\r\nAthletes participating in powerlifting can benefit from the belt. The sport involves moving weight from one point to another by any means. A belt can make the sport safer for its competitors. Lifters can benefit from the belt if performing around 80% or more of their one-rep max. Any lower weight may not call for one, unless a focus on breathwork is a desired practice. Lifters who compete in events should practice with one in order to maximize their numbers and prevent injury before the event.\r\n\r\nAthletes with previous injuries in or around the spine can benefit from the belt as well. It can act as a safety net, assuring that lumbar extension is not excessive. However, if someone is only experiencing acute low-back pain, they should opt to improve their form mechanics before wearing a belt and increasing the weight. For both groups, warming up the core before exercising can be beneficial.\r\n\r\nBelts should not be used during regular exercise. Some bodybuilders wear the belt in order to shrink their waist size, creating a V-taper before a show. This is not an optimal way to strengthen the core, especially for function.\r\n\r\nLastly, belts are not an excuse for weak abdominal muscles. They are a safety net for lifters working with heavy loads. If a stronger core is a personal goal, exercises for the core will show far more improvements. The belt is not a magical accessory for better abs, it’s a piece of equipment for physical activity.\r\n\r\nWrap-Up  \r\nCompound lifts are the core to a lifter’s routine. The belt ensures these lifters that they can improve the safety of these exercises while not impeding their gains. Not only will it minimize possible disadvantages, but it will improve the mechanics and results for lifters.', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/april/abs-and-forearms-into-your-routine-header-400x225.jpg', NULL, NULL),

There is some discipline required to maintain a consistent calorie surplus, but this adversity is offset by the muscle and strength gains you receive. Yet once the bulk is finished, it’s time for the cut. This is a time of cutting calories and extra cardio. It’s a time highly dreaded yet highly necessary. Learn how to make the weight loss journey of your training and diet as simple and painless as possible.\r\n\r\n<h2>Basics Of Weight Loss</h2>\r\nWhile we condone consuming a healthy diet in order to promote healthy weight loss and wellness, the only real requirement to losing weight is to maintain a calorie deficit over the course of several days or weeks. To achieve this requires the calories you burn in a day to be greater than the calories you consume. Fewer calories often conjures up images of starvation and miniscule portion sizes. We’re here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be this way.\r\n\r\nGetting your food choices in check, packing your diet full of quality lean protein, and filling up on whole foods will put you on the right track for shedding body weight and achieving your weight loss goals without too much of that dreaded hunger.\r\n\r\n<h2>Essential Foods For Healthy Eating</h2>\r\nThe key to picking foods is to select high protein options as well as high volume options. Protein preserves muscle mass and maintains satiety. Some great sources of craving-controlling proteins are chicken, lean ground beef, or low-fat greek yogurt. If you’re wanting something more plant based, then chickpeas, quinoa, black beans, legumes, or a high-quality protein supplement are other useful options.\r\n\r\nLarger volume foods with low calories are also great for controlling hunger and increasing health benefits: most veggies, leafy greens, low-calorie fruits such as blueberries, or things like popcorn work well. These foods are typically also high fiber, meaning they help with digestion, another great way to assist in weight management. Gut health keeps bloating down, which will keep you motivated during your weight loss plan.\r\n\r\nOur final recommendation is foods that take a while to eat. These include soups and other hot meals that take time to consume. The slower you eat, the better your body is able to avoid overeating.\r\n\r\n<h2>Superfoods In Action</h2>\r\nWeight loss diets don’t have to be hellish. There’s no requirement to get rid of carbs or throw out every gram of saturated fat. It all just comes down to calories in and calories out. At the end of the day, listen to your body and just stay aware of how the food your eating makes you feel. Eat what makes you happy and what gets you closer to your goals.', 'images/best-foods-for-weight-loss-header-830x467.jpg', NULL, NULL),
(23, 'How to Increase Testosterone for Optimal Performan', 'When it comes to testosterone, it’s more than just a hormone that helps with your sex drive. It helps your heart make new red blood cells, increases blood flow, promotes bone growth and density, increases muscle mass, aids in distribution of fat around the body, and other processes in the body [1]. \r\n\r\nIt’s important to understand how you can increase your levels naturally. Here are 4 tips on how to naturally increase your testosterone levels for optimal performance.\r\n\r\n<h2>Catching Those Quality ZZZ’s</h2>\r\nIn order for your hormones to be balanced properly, you’ll need to ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep each night. When it comes to testosterone and sleep, there may be a correlation. In fact, one study took data on over 2,000 teenage boys and men and found that impaired sleep was linked to lower levels of testosterone [2]. \r\n\r\nWhile there is no magic number for how many hours you should sleep, there was a small study that showed only sleeping five hours per night reduced testosterone by 10-15%, so we definitely recommend more than that [3]. Most research suggests at least seven hours of sleep per night, so make sure to aim for that severe to eight-hour mark [4]. \r\n\r\n<h2>A Balanced Plate </h2>\r\nWhat you eat and the quantity also plays a role in testosterone production. It is important to remember that constant dieting can negatively affect your hormone levels including testosterone [5]. \r\n\r\nInstead, you want to make sure you are properly balancing your macronutrients (proteins, carbs, and fats). Protein helps limit sex hormone-binding globulin and when you limit this, it helps your body produce more free testosterone to do its job [6]. Carbohydrates help play a role in controlling cortisol levels which affects testosterone. In a small study, researchers found that low-carbohydrate diets do negatively affect cortisol and testosterone levels [7]. As for fats, there is some research that shows low fat diets can lead to decreased testosterone [8].\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, you want to have a nutritious, well balanced diet consisting mainly of whole foods. A healthy balance of your macronutrients will help ensure your hormone levels are optimized for performance and support overall health.  \r\n\r\n<h2>Loosen Up </h2>\r\nStop stressing! When it comes to testosterone levels, stress can have quite a large impact. We’ve mentioned it before, but cortisol levels and testosterone have a direct correlation. When you have a lot of stress, especially prolonged amounts, it diminishes your testosterone levels [9]. \r\n\r\nNot only does stress impact cortisol levels, but it also causes other behaviors like increased food intake. Like mentioned above, you want to have a well balanced diet. If you increase food intake excessively, you will gain fat, especially around your organs. These factors could also negatively affect your testosterone levels [10]\r\n\r\n<h2>Move And Pick Up The Weights</h2>\r\nLast but not certainly not least, you need to move. Studies show that active men compared to sedentary men have higher testosterone levels [11]. What training should you do and how intense? It depends. In one review, they studied these questions and the effects on testosterone. While more studies need to be done, it does show the majority of any exercise and training intensity does raise testosterone levels [12]. \r\n\r\nNow, there are studies out there that show resistance training like weightlifting can have a remarkably positive effect on testosterone [13]. Because of this, it is recommended that you do some type of resistance training if you’re looking to increase testosterone and optimize your performance. \r\n ', 'images/how-to-increase-testosterone-for-optimal-performance-header-830x467.jpg', NULL, NULL),
(26, 'Building the Mind-Muscle Connection', 'If you spend enough time in the bodybuilder realm, you’re bound to hear this confusing phrase touted as one of the prime ways to build muscle. They claim that you just need more ‘muscle activation’ and ‘internal focus’ to achieve maximal muscle growth. These vague teachings seem no doubt more frustrating than they do helpful. Thankfully there’s truth in these confusing sayings, which we’ll explore down below.\r\n\r\nIs It Just Flexing Better?\r\nThe mind-muscle connection is mostly in the name. It’s strengthening the synaptic connections between your mind and your muscles as you exercise. This is something that develops over time. If you ask a beginner to flex their quadricep, they’ll likely be unable to. This is because their neurotransmitters aren’t used to firing in that specific pattern. However, after months of regularly performing deadlifts or leg extensions, they’ll likely have little issue doing so.\r\n\r\nIf It Just Happens Over Time, Do I Need To Do Anything?\r\nThis would be the obvious question to ask next. It appears that the more reps you do, the better mind-muscle connection you’ll have. Seems simple enough. However, working through a normal strength training program won’t be enough to really maximize what this training hack can do for you.\r\n\r\nThis method of focused muscle contraction can have great effects when it comes to hypertrophy. Since building muscle is all about breaking down muscle fibers, then focusing on that will be our main goal in the gym. A strong mind-muscle connection does just that. Feeling specific muscles engage in each part of a full range of motion is going to ensure that you’re getting the fullest amount of work from them possible. This also ensures that you’re hitting your target muscles and not accidentally engaging some other muscles.\r\n\r\nBuilding It Into Your Routine\r\nCompound movements are great for activating multiple muscle groups. Yet in order to best maximize mind-muscle connection when first starting out, you’re going to want to employ isolation exercises in your favor. These are great because they allow you to focus on one muscle at a time to really feel them work. Starting by slowly feeling your triceps work in a push down is going to be perfect. Keep the repetitions controlled and utilize a lighter weight. This way, you don’t have to think too hard about form and can instead devote your attention to how your triceps are feeling as they contract and relax. Do these types of isolation exercises for each muscle group you want to work: pec flys, side delt flys, bicep curls, glute kickbacks, any any other form of pinpointed muscle work.\r\n\r\nThis type of training will take time and repetition in order for those synaptic connections to really form. If you’re able to flex muscles individually, you’ll know you’re on the right track. Once this confidence starts to set in, take this mind-muscle connection into your compound lifts. Focus on feeling your muscles work in tandem the next time you’re doing a bench press, squat, or barbell row. Eventually, this mind-muscle connection will become so ingrained in your lifts that you activate the neural pathways without even being conscious about it. Pretty soon, you’ll be finding yourself explaining its complexities to your gym partner. Get that brain to work, and level up your weightlifting routine. There’s no reason brain and brawn shouldn’t combine to give you the best possible results.', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/april/building-the-mind-muscle-connection-header-830x467.jp', NULL, NULL),
(28, 'Top 5 Oils to Use for Cooking', 'When it comes to healthy cooking oils, there is plenty of unscientific information floating around the Internet. It feels like everyday you are told that the oil you have been using is now unhealthy. The latest attack has been on seed oils, such as canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soy, and sunflower oils. The first argument is that seed oils are filled with toxic byproducts from the use of chemical solvents, such as hexane. The second argument is that seed oils are unhealthy for you because they primarily contain omega-6 polyunsaturated fat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Harvard School of Public Health, the scientific evidence does not support these claims, because there is no clear evidence linking trace amounts of solvents to health issues (1). Evidence has shown that seed oils can actually help lower cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and reduce the risk of heart disease (1).\r\n\r\nWhat Is The Best Oil To Use?\r\nAccording to Teresa Fung at the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of ­Public Health, the nutrient makeup of your cooking oils is “not going to make a difference in terms of health, especially if you eat a healthy diet” (2). So go ahead and use your choice of minimally processed oil with moderation within the context of a well balanced diet.\r\n\r\nHere are three main factors when considering what oil to use: saturated or unsaturated fat, stability under heated conditions, and the amount of processing.\r\n\r\n1. Saturated or Unsaturated Fat\r\n\r\nAll fats can contain mix of three types of fat: monounsaturated fat contains omega-9 and is found in almonds, hazelnuts, avocados, sesame seeds, and olive oil; polyunsaturated fat contains omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and is found in fish, walnut oil, flaxseed oil, and vegetable oils; saturated fat is usually solid at room temperature and is found in animal fat, butter, coconut oil, and palm oil (3). The healthiest oils are those that are highest in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as vegetable oil and olive oil, which can help lower your bad cholesterol, raise your good cholesterol, and reduce your risk of heart disease (4).\r\n\r\n2. Stability Under Heated Conditions\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to cooking, some oils can handle the heat, and some can’t. An oil\'s ‘smoke point’ is the temperature at which it will start to smoke and break down. When oil hits that temperature, the molecules start to burn, destabilize, and lose their nutrients (2). Oils that reach their smoke point also release free radicals and a substance called acrolein which can cause lung irritation (5). In a similar vein, when oils are repeatedly heated, such as in deep-frying, the oil leads to lipid oxidation, which is inextricably linked to detrimental health effects such as cardiovascular disease (6).\r\n\r\nHere are some smoke point examples:\r\n\r\nUnrefined seed oils smoke at 225°F.\r\nButter smokes at 302°F.\r\nExtra Virgin olive oil smokes at 320°F.\r\nRefined oils smoke between 400°F and 500°F (7).\r\nYou should choose your oils based on your cooking method. Low smoke point oils such as flaxseed oil, extra-virgin olive oil, nut oils, and sesame oil can lose flavor and denature quickly when heated, so you should reserve them for salad dressing or drizzling on your finished dishes (2). Medium smoke point oils such as avocado oil, corn oil, canola oil, or virgin olive oil can be used for sauteing over medium heat (8). High smoke point oils such as peanut oil, soybean oil, light olive oil, and grapeseed oil can be used for high-heat frying, stir-frying, or roasting (2).\r\n\r\n3. Processing Method\r\n\r\nThe processing of your cooking oil can also dramatically change its flavor, color, smoke point, and health benefits. Highly refined oils are less expensive, have a uniform appearance, and much higher smoke points. Unrefined oils tend to be more costly, contain sediment, appear cloudier, have lower smoke points, but they do have more natural flavor (8).\r\n\r\nWhy Should You Even Bother With Using Cooking Oils?\r\nCooking oils contain fat, which is an essential macronutrient for a healthy diet that contains essential fatty acids not made by the human body. These fatty acids can help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Fat also helps facilitate the absorption of protein and the repairing of damaged tissue (9). In addition, fat is digested slower than protein or carbs, which can keep you feeling satiated longer. Fat can help regulate your metabolism and blood sugar and lower your risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease (10).\r\n\r\nOn the culinary side, cooking with fat can produce more delicious food. Greasing a pan can prevent food from sticking. Coating veggies with oil will allow for more even cooking. Adding oil to meat will enhance texture by browning the exterior, adding crispiness, keeping in moisture, concentrating flavors, and/or increasing aromas. Fat will also coat your taste buds with a smooth mouth feel, providing pleasurable richness (11).\r\n\r\nFive Of The Healthiest Cooking Oils According To Science\r\n1. Olive Oil\r\n\r\nOlive oil is on top of this list because of its versatility and well documented health benefits. Olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, has antioxidant properties, and can help reduce the ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol and improve ‘good’ HDL cholesterol (12)(13). There are two main types of olive oil: unrefined or refined. Unrefined olive oil, labeled as ‘extra-virgin olive oil,’ is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. Due to its lower smoke point at 320°F, EVOO is best used for medium heat cooking, baking, and salad dressings (14). Refined olive oil, labeled as light olive oil, is treated with some heat and chemicals to remove impurities and boost cooking stability. With its higher smoke point of 470°F, you can cook on high heats (15). Olive oil not only tastes great but is the cornerstone of the health promoting mediterranean diet.\r\n\r\n2. Avocado Oil\r\n\r\nAvocado oil is similar to extra virgin olive oil, with its high monounsaturated fat contents and a high percentage of the heart-healthy fat, oleic acid (16)(17). However, it has the added advantage of having a higher smoking point at approximately 520°F, allowing for higher cooking temperatures (18). One Study found that avocado oil maintains its nutritional quality at both low and high temperatures (18). This is a great option for high heat cooking. Plus avocado oil is neutral in flavor and can be used in any dish, including baked goods.\r\n\r\n3. Sesame Oil\r\n\r\nSesame oil is one of the oldest oils used in human civilization (19). It has been named the ‘Queen of Seed Oils,’ because of its resistance to oxidation and rancidity in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties (20). Sesame oil contains mostly polyunsaturated fatty acids and has a medium-high smoke point of approximately 410°F. Sesame seed oil has the added benefit of containing high amounts of vitamin K (21). It also contains anti-inflammatory compounds such as sesamol and sesaminol. which have been shown to lower cholesterol, prevent high blood pressure, increase vitamin E supplies, regulate blood sugar, and may even help with injury recovery (22)(23)(24)(25). Sesame oil works well as a general cooking oil or salad dressing. It has a mild nutty flavor that can pair well with Asian and Middle Eastern dishes. As a word of caution, toasted sesame oil should only be used to finish dishes and shouldn’t be heated.\r\n\r\n4. Grapeseed Oil\r\n\r\nGrapeseed oil is another great cooking oil because it is rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid, vitamins, and phenolic compounds that may have anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties (26)(27). Grapeseed oil has a high smoke point of 420°F, making it ideal for high heat cooking such as sautéing, roasting, and air frying. Grapeseed oil has a neutral flavor which can be used in all types of cooking and baking. It may promote overall skin health by tightening and contracting skin cells (28). The downside of this oil is that it is derived from the seeds of grapes and requires some chemical solvents to create, which may result in trace amounts of potentially harmful impurities such as hexane (29).\r\n\r\n5. Coconut Oil\r\n\r\nUnlike the previous four plant based unsaturated fat oils, coconut oil contains a fair amount of saturated fat. Although coconut oil has saturated fat, it contains a rich source of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which have been shown to help in weight loss, body fat regulation, and hip circumference reduction (30)(31)(32). MCTs are metabolized differently than long chain triglycerides, going straight to the liver to provide a rapid energy source similar to carbohydrates (33). There are two types of coconut oil. Unrefined coconut oil has a long shelf life but a medium smoke point of 350°F. Refined coconut oil has a more neutral flavor but has a high heat-resistance of 400°F. Both versions have powerful health benefits, such as improving cholesterol levels, killing harmful bacteria, helping with inflammation, and boosting metabolism (34)(35). The taste of coconut oil can range in intensity from distinctly tropical to almost neutral. Coconut oil is a staple in Southeast Asia, South America, and Polynesia cuisine for its warm nutty vanilla undertones.\r\n\r\nWhichever oil you choose, do it with confidence in your knowledge of its potential health benefits.', 'https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2023/january/top-5-oils-to-use-for-cooking-header-830x467.jpg', NULL, NULL);
